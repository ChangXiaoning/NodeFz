Turning a graphviz description file in the DOT language into a graphviz .dot file:
  dot -Tdot graphviz_graph2.gv -o graph2.dot
Turning a graphviz description file in the DOT language into a .ps file:
  dot -Tps graphviz_graph2.gv -o graph2.ps

Visualizing a .dot file:

Interactive graphs and GUIs:

I was wondering if I could interact with the CB graph and re-arrange nodes in it,
  then save the result to a new schedule.
  
Some options:
  http://www.graphviz.org/content/resources
    Long list of graphical interfaces. None of the recommended options I can see lets you *edit* the graph interactively.
  http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html
    Visualization only, no way to edit the graph.
    Works with DOT.

    Visualization and editing
    http://ivtk.sourceforge.net/api/infovis/graph/io/DOTGraphReader.html 
      Suggests that it may be able to play easily with DOT graphs

      Installed on my laptop, error'd out when I tried to open a .dot file.

      Misc suggestions
My overall conclusion is that a CLI will probably suffice, provided I can make node labels obvious enough
  that you can easily say "swap X and Y".
  I do observe that xdot will automatically update the image if it sees a change to the underlying file.
