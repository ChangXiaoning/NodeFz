Overview:
This directory contains tools for visualizing the result of recorded node runs.

----------------------------

Graph visuals
  Callback.py
    classes to represent libuv callbacks in python
  cbGraphVis
    CLI to parse a schedule file generated by scheduler.c:scheduler_emit at the end of a node run.
    Produces an output file in dot format
    Requires you to install the python gv module

    Example: ./cbGraphVis --onlyExecuted --execOrder timer_repeat.sched timer_repeat.gv

----------------------------

Timeline visuals
  libtimeline.py
  timelineCLI.py

  I've stopped using timeline for now, since I added the --execOrder flag to cbGraphVis.
  I may revisit them in the future.
  I don't know if they work, since I've tweaked the output format of scheduler.c:scheduler_emit.
